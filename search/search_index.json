A: You'll need: The Vortex86EX system-on-module (SOM). An ATX-compatible Power Supply Unit (PSU). An AGP graphics card A microSD card, USB flash drive or SATA SSD or hard drive Q: What's the performance of this system like? A: The Vortex86EX CPU can be clocked from 60-500 MHz, and has L1 and L2 caches that can be turned on and off. At 500 MHz with caches enabled, the CPU is roughly comparable in speed to an Intel Pentium 233 MMX. At 60 MHz with caches disabled, it's performing similarly to a 386. Q: Can I use an AGP riser to mount AGP graphics cards into modern compact ITX cases? A: At this time, it is recommended that risers and 90-degree adapters be avoided until further testing has been done. AGP has very strict timing tolerances that likely means most adapters won't work reliably. Plan to use low-profile AGP cards if small cases are desired. Q: Does the ITX-Llama support adding a PicoGUS (or other ISA peripherals)? A: Unfortunately no. The Vortex86EX has a stripped-down ISA interface with only a single DMA channel, and that is being used by the Crystal sound chip. Q: Can I connect an Optical drive? A: Yes. You can either use a SATA Optical drive connected to the onboard SATA port or an IDE to SATA adapter paired with an IDE Optical drive. IDE Optical drives typically have audio output which can be connected to the onboard Crystal sound card. Q: What kind of PSU should I use? A: Any kind will work! The board and CPU uses very little power, only a few watts. The AGP card can draw a little more, but the overall system power consumption will still be comfortably lower than what every modern PSU can deliver. PicoPSUs can be used for saving space. Q: Should the Vortex86EX SOM be actively cooled? A: It probably won't have to be, if you have some air flow through the case. If you want to overclock the CPU or have limited air flow, a fan can be mounted above the SOM using the 4 holes around the SOM pin headers on the motherboard. There are also 3 independently controllable (through the BIOS settings menu) fan pin headers on the board. These follow the standard 4-pin PWM fan specification, and can be set to provide 5V or 12V by jumper. Q: What kind of ethernet controller is used? A: There's a built-in RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet (10/100Mbit) controller on the Vortex86EX. This controller has drivers both for DOS and Windows 98. Q: What kind of USB standard is supported? A: The two connectors below the Ethernet port are USB 2.0. With a flash drive plugged in, they can either be used as fixed disks in DOS and Windows (appearing to the operating systems as regular hard drives) or as removable storage. This is configured in the BIOS setting menu. Additionally, there are two USB HID-only ports you can use to connect modern USB keyboards and mice. The HID protocol is translated into PS/2 using an RP2040 chip on the motherboard, and the connected devices appear as regular PS/2 input devices to the operating system. Q: What kind of serial communication does the board offer? A: There are two high-speed UARTs on the board. The first (COM1) uses a standard DE-9M connector on the back side, has a proper high-voltage (+/- 12V) RS-232 transceiver for reliable signalling and is good for at least 115200 baud speeds. It has all the 8 signal lines available. The other UART (COM2) only has data lines (RX/TX), uses TTL logic-level (5V) and is connected to the ESP8266 module and an internal pin header. This can be run at anywhere up to 3 Mbps. Q: What's the deal with the ESP8266 module? A: This module offers an emulated Hayes-compatible modem (on COM2), and talks to your WiFi network. This means you can connect to BBSes on telnet (there are still many out there!) the old skool way, or even connect to the internet on Windows 98 using dial-up networking! Q: How do I connect a keyboard and mouse? A: You can choose whether to use real PS/2 keyboards/mice or modern USB variants. Configured by jumpers. Q: What's the sound card on this board? A: It's the Crystal Semi / Cirrus Logic CS4237B - which is a Sound Blaster Pro 2 / Windows Sound System compatible chip, working great in both DOS and Windows. It has a very good built-in Adlib/OPL3 FM synth as well, a powerful mixer for various input sources, and can output both analog line-level audio and digital audio (S/PDIF) using a TOSLink optical transmitter connector. Q: What's the point of the internal OPL3 header receptacle? A: While the CS4237B's emulated OPL3 synth is quite respectable, it's not a perfect 1:1 implementation of the Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3). This is where the OPL3 module comes into play. By plugging in such a module, you get the actual authentic OPL3 hardware using real Yamaha chips. Sound-wise, it's a subtle difference, but it's there. Q: What are my options for audio input/output? A: For output you have analog (line-level) and digital (S/PDIF) audio. Inputs are microphone (with a built-in pre-amp), line-in and analog CD audio. Line-in can be set (using jumpers) to either the external 3.5mm jack (for external MIDI synthesizers, for example), or internal - from a wavetable plugin card or a software-based MT-32 or MIDI synth on a Raspberry Pi. Q: What kind of internal synthesizers can I use? A: There are three internal synth connectors on the board. The first is the 26-pin wavetable connector. Here you can plug in MIDI wavetable cards such as the X2, X2GS, X16, X16GS, etc. from Serdashop - these are modern cards using the Dream chipset and uses soundfonts to replicate various MIDI synthesizers. You've also got two 40-pin connectors for plugging in a Raspberry Pi. Either use the male header with a 40-pin female-female ribbon cable to connect a standard Pi 3 or 4, or you can plug a Pi Zero 2's pins directly into the female connector. Since the Raspberry Pis are full computers in their own sense, they can run all kinds of software synthesizers and output digital I2S audio to the motherboard. There's a PCM5102 DAC on the board to convert the audio to analog, and then feed it into the Crystal sound chip. The easiest way to get a Pi up and running as a synth is to use the mt32-pi software which requires minimal effort. It'll do MT-32 using the munt emulator, and General MIDI using the fluidsynth application with soundfonts. If you're adventurous and have a Pi 4, you can also run the SC-55 emulator nuked-sc55 on a regular Debian installation, for an extremely accurate Roland SC-55 sound. Q: What about the game port connector? A: The game port connector offers joystick/gamepad support through the Crystal sound card. In addition, you have MIDI input and output, so you can connect an external synth (like the Roland MT-32 or SC-55) using a standard gameport-to-MIDI breakout cable. Q: What's the AGP compatibility of the ITX-Llama? A: The mechanical/electrical connector on the board is 3.3V-keyed. That means AGP cards with the 3.3V-notch (towards the VGA connector-side of the card) as well as \"universal\" cards with two notches will fit and run. 1.5V-keyed cards with only the notch towards the opposite side of the VGA connector will neither fit nor be compatible with the motherboard's 3.3V-signal level. From a protocol perspective, this is AGP 1x, with some caveats. A quite technical summary; there is no native AGP support on the Vortex86EX, only PCI Express x1 (gen 1). This is converted to PCI at 66 MHz by an onboard PI7C9X118 chip. Since AGP is really only PCI running at a higher clock frequency (66 vs 33 MHz), this is fine. However, AGP supports additional features not found on PCI, like split transactions, sideband addressing and GART. What this means is that AGP cards where the Windows driver requires one or more of these AGP-only features will not work properly. In practice, most older cards should work just fine and are probably a better fit for the CPU's speed as well. Of note is the Radeon 9200 / 9250, as well as the Voodoo3 - these have been tested extensively and found to be a very good match. Q: Does the board have front panel connectors? A: Yes, power button, reset button, power LED and SD card activity LED. Q: Does the board have a PC speaker? A: Yes, an internal one (with two volume settings, configured by jumper), and a pin header for connecting an external speaker. Q: Which operating systems are supported? A: MS-DOS, FreeDOS and early Windows (3.1, 95, 98). Q: Which storage devices can be booted from and run an operating system? A: All of them; microSD, USB and SATA. Q: My question isn't listed here, where can I learn more? A: Try asking in the ITX-Llama thread on the Vogons forum , or join the Discord server .","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"faq/#itx-llama-faqs","text":"Q: What do I need in addition to the ITX-Llama board?

Below is a breakdown of each option and several add-ons that are compatible. OPL-3 FM Synthesis Support \uf0c1 Out of the box, the Crystal CS4237B sound chip can emulate OPL-3 through its Crystal FM synthesis engine. This is a close approximation to a genuine Yamaha OPL-3 for most titles but has been known to fall short in certain cases. The ITX Llama offers an OPL-3 header which accepts a custom OPL-3 board containing an old-stock Yamaha YMF262-M FM synth chip. This will provide a geniune Yamaha OPL-3 sound for games utilizing FM Synthesis. Roland MT-32 Support \uf0c1 A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is capabilty of emulating a Roland MT-32 using the excellent Munt emulator. To facilitate this as a drop-in feature, the mt32-pi project add this functionality to a simple Pi Zero 2 and installed onto the ITX Llama for direct audio support. Pros: provides a near perfect emulation of the Roland MT-32 / CM-32L audio is routed through an onboard DAC to the Crystal sound chip via i2c preventing the need for additional hardware besides the Pi Zero 2 itself and an SD card. Additional features: mt32-pi supports General MIDI using the FluidSynth engine and user-supplied sound fonts. ITX Llama users could techincally employ just the Pi Zero 2 with mt32-pi in addition to the OPL-3 module to cover nearly all bases of MIDI in early DOS games. Installation: A Raspberry Pi 4 can also be attached in lieu of the Pi Zero 2. This is a much more advanced option but opens the possibility of running a full OS with Munt, FluidSynth and a modified version of the nuked-SC-55 emulator for geniune Roland SC-55 sound support. An IDE cable affixed to the pins on board below and to the Raspberry Pi 4 is necessary to use this feature. At this time, system setup for the Pi 4's OS is up to the user. Pin Header: ( below the female Pi Zero 2 header ) Wavetable MIDI Support \uf0c1 The ITX Llama contains a Wavetable compatible header as well. This can be configured with a variety of Wavetable Synth modules to provide General MIDI support through the Crystal sound chip.

To facilitate this as a drop-in feature, the mt32-pi project add this functionality to a simple Pi Zero 2 and installed onto the ITX Llama for direct audio support. Pros: provides a near perfect emulation of the Roland MT-32 / CM-32L audio is routed through an onboard DAC to the Crystal sound chip via i2c preventing the need for additional hardware besides the Pi Zero 2 itself and an SD card. Additional features: mt32-pi supports General MIDI using the FluidSynth engine and user-supplied sound fonts. ITX Llama users could techincally employ just the Pi Zero 2 with mt32-pi in addition to the OPL-3 module to cover nearly all bases of MIDI in early DOS games. Installation: A Raspberry Pi 4 can also be attached in lieu of the Pi Zero 2. This is a much more advanced option but opens the possibility of running a full OS with Munt, FluidSynth and a modified version of the nuked-SC-55 emulator for geniune Roland SC-55 sound support. An IDE cable affixed to the pins on board below and to the Raspberry Pi 4 is necessary to use this feature. At this time, system setup for the Pi 4's OS is up to the user.

For feedback, suggestions, etc. - please add a post to the Vogons thread . Contents \uf0c1 Building your own Installing the SOM Jumper Configuration PS/2 and USB HID Line In Pi or Wavetable Flashing the BIOS DOS Mouse in DOS Audio in DOS Windows 98 Windows 98 Drivers TBPlus USB Crystal Audio Ethernet Fans mt32-pi Installing the SOM \uf0c1 When installing the Vortex86EX SOM, carefully align the module as shown in the image below, and gently push it down on the 64 pins. Note that the pins on the motherboard are quite thin and fragile, and if you misalign the SOM or use excessive force, they'll likely bend or break. Take your time, be careful and double-check the placement before proceeding further! Jumper Configuration \uf0c1 The board should come preinstalled with all the jumpers necessary. For changing the configuration, here's a quick walkthrough of the different jumpers and their functionality. PS/2 or USB HID \uf0c1 Jumpers: J7, J12, J15, J16 If you want to use a real PS/2 keyboard connected to the purple PS/2 port, place the two topmost jumpers (J15 and J16) to the leftmost position (\"PS/2\"). For USB HID keyboard connected to one of the white USB ports (between the PS/2 and serial port), place the jumpers to the rightmost side (\"USB\"). Same goes for PS/2 mouse and jumpers J7 and J12. Line In \uf0c1 Jumpers: J39, J40 If you want to use an external audio source connected to the blue 3.5mm jack port, place both jumpers to the leftmost position (\"EXT\"). For using a Raspberry Pi Zero2 or Wavetable board as line-in to the sound card, place the two jumpers to the rightmost position (\"INT\"). Pi or Wavetable \uf0c1 Jumpers: J25, J26, J27 For using a Raspberry Pi (Zero2, 3 or 4) for converting MIDI to analog audio, place the three jumpers to the rightmost position (\"PI\"). For using a wavetable board, place the jumpers to the leftmost position (\"WT\"). Flashing the BIOS \uf0c1 If you've purchased the Vortex86EX system-on-module (SOM) from DMP, ICOP, etc - you need to flash the BIOS first. Since the BIOS that comes pre-installed on the SOM is set up for another pinout/configuration, the microSD card slot isn't availble yet, and you need to use a USB flash drive for this part. Format the flash drive with a DOS-bootable FAT16/32 partition and copy over the ANYBIOS.EXE and ITXBIOS.ROM files . Alternatively (and easier), just do a block-level transfer of the INITBIOS.IMG file to the flash drive using Balena Etcher , dd or something similar. Then place the flash drive in one of the USB ports (the ones below the RJ45 port). Plug a USB keyboard in the other port. Note : at this point, a keyboard plugged into one of the two HID-only (white) ports won't work, you need to use the ones below the RJ45 port! Power up the system, and hopefully you'll get a DOS prompt. From there just type: anybios w itxbios.rom Once done, shut down the computer, remove the flash drive and move the keyboard to one of the HID ports. DOS \uf0c1 Follow these instructions to set up DOS on a microSD card, SATA drive or USB flash drive: (Note: a SATA drive is faster, but this isn't that important in DOS. I recommend using a microSD card, because you'll be able to use the \"clicker\" feature to simulate the seeking sounds of an old spinning drive, if you're interested in that) 1. Turn off the system, insert a drive of choice. 2. Boot the system, press ESC to bring up the boot menu. 3. Choose the Virtual Floppy drive. 4. Run fdisk , select and partition the drive however you want. Make sure to have at least one primary partition, and make it Active . 5. Quit fdisk and reboot the system. 6. Once again, boot the system using the Virtual Floppy drive. 7. Run fdisk /mbr to write the correct MBR bytes to the new drive. 8. Run format c: /s to format the new drive and copy over the necessary system files. 9. Shut down the machine and remove the drive. 10. Copy over DOS and whatever else you want from a modern computer. Mouse in DOS \uf0c1 Use CuteMouse (CTMOUSE.EXE) . Audio in DOS \uf0c1 The Crystal CS4237B sound chip is automatically initialized and configured from the BIOS, so you don't need any drivers in DOS. If you wish to change any of the mixer settings, use CWDMIX.EXE . Windows 98 \uf0c1 Before proceeding, I'd strongly recommend using a SATA drive for Windows 98, as the performance is noticably better than running from an SD card or USB drive. Download Windows 98 SE from WinWorldPC . Product keys are there as well. Prepare a bootable DOS drive (see the DOS section above), copy the WIN98 folder over to the drive and run the SETUP.EXE from within. Note: at some point during the installation, you'll get a crash. This is due to the IDE driver being incompatible with the Vortex86EX's IDE controller. Reboot, and choose \"Safe Mode\". From within Win98, install the TBPLUS drivers from R. Loew and then reboot again and complete the installation. An easier way is to install Windows 98 SE is using a version I've prepared which has the IDE drivers \"slipstreamed\" (meaning that Windows will use the updated drivers automatically). Windows 98 Drivers \uf0c1 TBPlus \uf0c1 If you installed the TBPlus drivers during the Windows 98 installation, or used the slipstreamed Windows 98 installer you're all set. If not, install the TBPlus drivers . USB \uf0c1 In the BIOS Settings, you can choose to have USB flash drives appear to the system as fixed disks. With this setting enabled, they'll show up as regular hard drives in DOS and Windows. If you turn this setting off , you can use flash drives as removable storage in Windows 98. Use nusb36e.exe to install the required drivers. Crystal Audio \uf0c1 Run SETUP.EXE from the Crystal Audio driver folder. Ethernet \uf0c1 From Device Manager, find the Ethernet device and install the RDC R6040 driver . Fans \uf0c1 The Vortex86EX SOM doesn't draw much power, and shouldn't require active cooling if running at or below 300 MHz. If you do wish to add one or more fans, the motherboard has three separately controllable 4-pin PWM fan connectors: Simply connect a modern 4-pin fan to one of these headers, and set the corresponding jumper to either 5V or 12V: Note: Take care not to supply 12V to a 5V fan - you'll likely fry it. mt32-pi \uf0c1 If you want to use a Raspberry Pi as an MT-32 or MIDI synthesizer, download and install the mt32-pi bare-metal software on the Pi, and plug it into the motherboard. If you go with a Pi Zero 2 (the easiest and cheapest option), make sure to solder the 40-pin connector to the bottom side of the Pi, as seen here: Look at the mt32-pi github page for setup, configuration options etc. As a minimum, you want to set the output of the mt32-pi as type \"i2s\": output_device = i2s Use the mt32-pi-control software from DOS to switch between MT-32 and MIDI mode.","title":"User's Guide"},{"location":"user-guide/#itx-llama-users-guide","text":"Note This document is still a work in progress.
