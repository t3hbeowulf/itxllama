## BOM
There's a BOM file [here][bom], ready to be used with JLCPCB's assembly service.
In addition to the components that can be sourced through JLC/LCSC, you need to order a few extras elsewhere:
- Vortex86EX SOM - [DMP][som]
- Crystal CS4237B - Search for "cs4237b" on [eBay][ebay]
- ATTINY84A-PU - [DigiKey][digikey], [Mouser][mouser], etc
- > **Note:** For programming the ATTiny, you need a hardware AVR programmer. There are plenty out there.

If you want emulated modem:
- D1 Mini v4.0.0 (ESP8266) - [AliExpress][d1mini]
